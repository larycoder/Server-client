# Ver2: read rfc1459 (sep 10 2019)
# Ver2: Implement server for multiple client connection (oct 12 2019)
# Ver2: Server now can read multiple client and broadcast that message, but I do not have suitable client side for testing server, so my next intend is build simple client for handling and testing server (oct 30 2019)
# Ver2: It is better if server and client communicating on 2 sockets (1 for read and 1 for write). It help limitation of connection expand.
