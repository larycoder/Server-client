# Ver 1:
I implements TCP Client-Server in C language for first step in understanding this model. I follows [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-server-client-implementation-in-c/) as guidelines

## Ver 1.01:
Client Side will ask Ip from user => that mean server client can be distributed into LAN network instead of local host

# Ver 2:
After testing TCP connection with a little bit of success, we move forward to next step: developing the IRC server and client for chatting.

## Ver 2.01:
I want to build simple server implement IRC protocol based on rfc1459 and rfc2810. I do not have any further intent.
